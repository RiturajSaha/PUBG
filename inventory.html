<p>Helmets are a type of equipment in PUBG. Helmets provide head protection but they do not provide extra capacity. Head armor will last until fully destroyed by gunfire or other types of damage and will block the full damage even if it has only 1 point of armor left. It is useful to pick up a helmet no matter what level it is as it provides protection against instant-kills with head shots, most of the time. </p>
<p>For example, a level 3 helmet can still protect you from a headshot even if it's damaged. </p>

<p>Vests are a type of equipment in PUBG. They provide basic protection and an increase in carrying capacity. Each vest increases the carrying capacity by 70 units. Body armor will last until fully destroyed by gunfire or other types of damage and will block the full damage even if it has only 1 point of armour left. It is useful to pick up a vest no matter what level it is as it provides protection against instant-kills with body shots, most of the time.</p>
<p>For example, a damaged level three vest is better than a full health level 2 vest.</p>

<p>According to this table the AKM and GROZA have more damage due to their ammo type i.e 7.62mm ammo. The AUG is the best weapon along with all the attachments. The M416, SCAR-L, M16A4, AUG take 5.56mm ammo. Each weapon's magazine size is 30 bullets and after attaching extended mag they contain 40 bullets each. Each weapon has two modes-auto and single but the M16A4 has single and burst fire mode. According to some tests the AKM has the most recoil out of all the ARs ecluding the M16A4 beacuse it has burst mode and the AUG has the least recoil.</p>
<p>* AUG and Groza are crate only weapons.</p>

<p>Light Machine Guns are essentially weapons that boast higher rate of fire over Assault Rifles and a slight increase in bullet damage, but with a much higher drop off in terms of range and ammo carrying capacity. While LMGs themselves can fire more bullets, they go through these bullets much faster, and because of how many of them there are, you go through them a lot faster too. This limits their usefulness dramatically.</p>

<p>Sniper Rifles are the ultimate weapons when it comes to range and power.   In general, these rifles suffer from low magazine sizes and a   cripplingly low rate of fire, but are redeemed by their high damage and   extreme range capabilities. Due to the small magazine sizes and slow   rate of fire, one must use these rifles with extreme caution, as one   shot missed could spell the end for the user, and multiple shots missed   means a long time of being vulnerable while reloading or switching   weapons. According to test results the AWM does the most damage but one downside is that it is a crate only gun. The AWM can take out a level 3 helmet with one shot only, and takes 2 shots to take out level 3 vest.</p>

<p>DMRs, or Designated Marksman Rifles, are weapons between the Assault Rifles and Sniper Rifles categories. Broadly speaking, they've got just short of the range of a   sniper rifle, and just slightly higher damage than an assault rifle,   albeit with a slightly lower magazine size. Functionally speaking,   they're a great short to medium range precision rifle, but they're not   that great in assault situations.</p>
<p>The VSS takes 9mm bullets and the MINI-14 takes 5.56mm and the rest takes 7.62mm bullets. The MK14 and the VSS have two modes- single and auto. The SKS , MINI-14 , SLR are semi automatic rifles. These have reasonable fire rates .The VSSs has its own type of scope. The rest take all the scope attachments.</p>

<p>Shotguns are weapons designed to fire shell cartridges that are   different from normal bullet cartridges. Shells are usually loaded with a   kind of pellets that can vary in size depending on the desired   application. The shell is loaded with a wad that acts as a wall, pushing   the pellets or payload out of the shell cartridge. This means that most   rifles used for shooting shotgun shells uses normal barrels without   rifling which makes them less effective for shooting bullets designed   for rifled barrels. Because of the spread of the pellets, the shotgun is less useful over   larger distances, as the traveling projectiles tend to travel away from   the center of the predicted bullet path eventually covering the area   much like a cone shape. With an adjustment of the barrel using a choke,   the rifle can direct most of the pellets in a more narrow path, making   the shotgun more effective even at medium ranges.</p>

<p>P18C or the Glock has two firing modes i.e single and auto. The best powerful pistol is R1895. The best overall pistol is P1911 with an extended mag. Pistols are great secondary weapons, but when it tight situations when you dont have any weapons they can also function as   primaries. Because they do decent damage at decent range, they're sort   of an "all around okay" weapon. Replace with an actual main weapon as   soon as you can, though, because the limited ammo carry and damage   rating will harm you in the long run.</p>

<p>Melee weapons are often a weapon of last resort - they don't have any   range and have poor "rate of fire". That being said, if you can get the   drop on your enemy, you can absolutely use these weapons to great   effect, getting a relatively easy kill. That's hard to do, though, so as   said before, you should really consider them sidearms or weapons of   last resort. Pan is the ultimate melee weapon it does the most damage. You can use it to kill the last enemy for a chicken dinner or use it troll enemy or ninja momments.</p>

<p>Grenade are very useful in diffenrent scenarios. Frag genades and Molotov cocktails are used to clear out buildings. Smoke grenades are used to hide yourselves in the open, hide the air drops to easily loot it and kill other incoming enemies. They are also useful to revive downed teamates in the open. Flash grenades as the name suggests are used to blind your opponents and advance them. We can also use them to advance into buildings.</p>

<p>CrossBows are a decent weapons, but only for very specific purposes during the end when there are less players alive. Crossbow does a one shot headshot kill with level 3 helmet or lower. These are can be used to kill enemies silently. Bows   don't make much noise, so they're great to use when initially taking on a   team, as a good shot or two can take out one member without giving away   where you actually are. That being said, try to trade out bows when you   can for better ranged weapons unless you're using a very specific defensive stratergy. Crossbow shoots only one crossbow bolt at a time. It can take 2 attachments i.e a sight and a quiver(helps to reload the bolt faster).</p>

<p>Each Bandage apllied restores 10 health over 4 secs. The First Aid kit instantly restores 75 health. The FirstAid kit takes 6 secs to apply. Both the bandages and the firstaid kit only restores 75 health. But the Medkit restores 100 health but it takes 8 secs to apply. Painkillers,Energy Drinks,Adrenaline Syringe are caled boosters. They increase the characters boost to help increasing stamina and restore health slowly. Painkillers incease the character's boost by 60, it has 6 secs of cast time. one painkiller lasts for 3 mins restoring 40 health. Energy Drinks increase the character's boost by 40, it has 4 secs of cast time. one energy drink lasts for 2 mins restoring 23 health. Energy Drinks have a capacity of 4 where as Painkillers have a capacity of 10 hence it is more reasonable to carry more Energy Drinks than painkillers because they occupy less space. Adrenaline Syringe increase the character's boost by 100, it has 6 secs cast time. one Adrenaline Syringe will last for 5 mins regenerating all the health and an extra 6.2% movement speed increase. one Adrenaline Syringe is equal to consuming two Painkillers or one Painkiller and two Energy Drinks.</p>
