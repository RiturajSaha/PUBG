<br /><h3>
<p>Arcade is a very different gaming experience. First of all, Arcade mode is limited to 28 players, so it's fast and furious, all guns blazing - it's like PUBG Mobile on fire. It's a crazy adrenaline rush in there. 

<p>To stand any chance of surviving you need to get on the ground as quickly as possible, into a house and gather weapons. These are more liberally placed and generally more powerful than the spread in normal gaming. Then it's finger to the trigger and try to stay within the safe area.
  
<p>Arcade is mostly fighting in built-up areas and you are not ranked in arcade mode.
  
<br />
<p>Arcade mode has the following four sub-modes-</p>
