<p ><b><u> MAP </b></u></p>
<p><b>Sanhok</b>, previously known as Savage, is for players who're up for a little more feisty a challenge than usual. this new map is, of course, smaller than the other two maps Erangel and Miramar that already exist - with both of those coming in at 8 kilometres by 8 kilometres, to this one's four by four, and the player count sticking to 100 per round.
Being half the size of Erangel and Miramar, Sanhok brings frantic early-game firefights, still a fairly quiet mid-game, and faster circles to hurry up the move to the late-game.</p>
