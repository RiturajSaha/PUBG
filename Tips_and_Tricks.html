<ul>
  <li> PUBG is a game about survival of the fittest. While this can   mean the most aggressive player wins, it is by far not the average case.   Knowing when to engage and when to lay low is key in having your first   chicken dinner.</li>
  <li> PUBG rewards an active playstyle. Just as much as being too   aggressive will probably get you killed, being too passive will mean   your opponents will have more and more of a tactical advantage through   their gear.</li>
  <li>Sound plays a key role in PUBG. Making use of the ingame sound can make all the difference. Knowing   where shots are fired, where cars are driven and listening to that all   too careless player stomping around in his punk boots all make for a   great way to either engage on your terms, or make sure you dont engage   at all.</li>
  <li> Know your strengths and weaknesses. While most players would love   to excel in every aspect of the game, every player has their own   strengths and weaknesses. Be aware of what you are capable of and make   sure the situations you get yourself in favor your strengths and avoid   your weaknesses.</li>
  <li> Make use of every distraction. Sometimes you are pinned behind   cover with no way out or you know where an enemy is, but can't get close   without them seeing you. In those cases, using grenades is not your   only option. Make use of the red zone, of the impending blue circle, of   nearby gunfire, your teammates or even the loud sound of the airplane to   get out of a bad situation, or into a good situation. Oftentimes, your   opponent wont be able to track your movement.</li>
  <li>A big part of BATTLEGROUNDS is playing the map. Understanding the   general concept of where people are likely to go, how to move silently,   and so forth are key to your long-term survival. </li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="Playing_solo">1. For Playing solo</span></h3>
<ul>
  <li> As a solo player, you will always have some blind spots. While   some positions will allow you to make sure no one sneaks up to you, as   soon as you are in the open field, you will often have to rely on   knowing where other players are probably going to be. Always keep track   of how far the blue circle is, where the new white circle is, and how   likely it is that someone is behind you.</li>
  <li> Since you have no team to rely on, a single unsuppressed shot, even   if it kills someone, can lead to your death. Players around your   position will have a vague idea of where you are, while you probably   don't know where they are. It is rarely advised to kill someone while   completely exposed, even if your target is "an easy kill."</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="Playing_duo.2Fsquad">2. For Playing duo/squad</span></h3>
<ul>
  <li> When playing with a team, it is important to make sure that all   players have the same gameplan. Some players enjoy playing fast and   ending rounds quickly, while others have a more tactical approach and   aim for the endgame. If the team does not follow the same gameplan, the   players will oftentimes not work as a team. Further, players need to   work as a team. Players that 'wander off from the tour group' are   exposing themselves and their team to higher risk.</li>
  <li> When playing with a team, you can make sure all angles are secure   at all times. This, however, requires communication. Make sure you use   voice chat (or other methods of communication) to alert your teammates   whenever something important is happening around you. Use the in-game   compass (or notable site names) to inform your team where and what is   happening.</li>
  <li> An early death of a teammate does not automatically mean a round is   lost and dying early yourself can be a great opportunity to learn from   your teammates. If you are really not interested in watching the rest of   the match when dead, maybe do something else until the match is   finished. Ranting will only inhibit your team even further.</li>

<a href="Tips_and_Tricks.html"><p>Back to the Top</p></a>
<a name="assualt"><p class="loadout">BEST ASSUALT LOADOUT</p></a>
<p><b><u>MAIN WEAPON -</u></b></p>
<p>Because the assault loadout is focused heavily on damage, we recommend using the AKM.   It has a ton of damage behind it with decent range and accuracy,   meaning you can engage from mid range effectively while dealing good   damage. The AKM is actually pretty decent up close too, which handles a   lot of the negatives of our sidearm pick. You can also pick the SCAR-L because it has a good firerate and has less recoil. Ypu should have attachments like the compensator or the suppressor, and the Ext. mag.</p>
<p><b><u>SIDEARMS -</u></b></p>
<p>For a sidearm you can also pick a decent AR which has less recoil and more bullet travel speed i.e the M16A4 attached with a 4X or a 6X scope for some range. Or you can pick a SMG like the UMP9 or the VECTOR with an Extended Quickdraw Magazine.</p>
<p><b>MELEE -</b></p>
<p>The almighty PAN is the saviour..</p>
<a href="Tips_and_Tricks.html"><p>Back to the Top</p></a>
<a name="defence"><p class="loadout">BEST DEFENSIVE LOADOUT</p></a>
<p><b><u>MAIN WEAPON -</u></b></p>
<p>As your priority is defensive you should have all your weapons suppressed so that it will reduce the noise of the weapon.The M249 is a   great main weapon for the defense class. While it's not really a damage   dealer per se, its effective range and really awesome fire rate means   that you can keep enemies at range while you retreat to a better   location. You can also carry the M16A4 or the AKM.</p>
<p><b><u>SIDEARMS -</u></b></p>
<p>This might be a controversial choice, but the Crossbow is actually a really good sidearm choice. Because it deals a lot of   damage in a single shot and it is the only silent weapon in the game but takes forever to rearm, it's a good last   ditch weapon in close combat where accuracy isn't that important. When cornered, switching to the crossbow, and firing off a single   shot to center mass or the head is enough to neutralize a threat   quietly. Alternately, this is a great weapon to take out an enemy at   range. </p>
<p>As for the attachments you should carry a Red Dot Sight or atmost a 4X scope.</p>
<a href="Tips_and_Tricks.html"><p>Back to the Top</p></a>
<a name="close"><p class="loadout">BEST CLOSE QUARTER COMBAT LOADOUT</p></a>
<p>when landing with a ton of enemies in a single place you will havemany close quarter combat situations.</p>
<p><b><u>MAIN WEAPON -</u></b></p>
<p>For this loadout's main weapon, we suggest the S12K. The main draw of   the S12K is that it's a highly powerful shotgun with a ton of stopping   power, which makes it great for close quarters combat, and it has the   high fire rate of a semi-auto. While you lose quite a bit of range going with something like the   S12K, that doesn't really matter in houses or small areas, as the range   is ultimately negated as a concern the second you get within a handful   of feet.</p>
<p><b><u>SIDEARMS -</u></b></p>
<p>The R189 revolver makes a perfect sidearm for this build. While it shines in terms of   stopping power, making it a great companion for the S12K, the main   benefit of the R1895 is the fact that it has a pretty good effective   range and stability rating. This extended range and stability should allow you to deal some   initial damage from midrange before you draw the S12K, tipping the   scales in your favor. In a game like BATTLEGROUNDS, even a small   advantage like that is very, very valuable. </p>
<p>A good secondary approach is to forget the firearm angle, and go for a melee weapon. The Crowbar would be our pick here, as it offers decent damage for limited   capacity. That being said, you should definitely go for the firearm   rather than the melee weapon, as depending on melee means you have to   get so close that you're essentially evening the odds in a fire   situation. </p>
<a href="Tips_and_Tricks.html"><p>Back to the Top</p></a>
<a name="range"><p class="loadout">BEST RANGED LOADOUT -</p></a>
<p><b><u>MAIN WEAPON -</u></b></p>
<p>The AWM is by   far the best weapon of this type. With amazing stopping power and   effective range, this rifle does a huge amount of damage to anything it   hits. For this loadout, this is best paired with a stability attachment,   as it will let you "post up" either on roads or near towns, picking off   enemies as they move about.</p>
<p>You can also any other sniper with a flash hider or suppressor.</p>
<p><b><u>SIDEARMS -</u></b></p>
<p>You can carry a SMG or a VSS. For your sidearm, the P92 is a great choice. Sniping often means that people are going to try and   sneak up on you. Having a medium power pistol with a relatively shorter   effective range (but with the requisite tradeoff of higher rate of   fire) means that if you are cornered, you can whip around and unload a   mag into the enemy.</p>
<p><b>CONSUMABLES for each category of LOADOUT - </b></p>
<p>atleast one MED-KIT and one ADRENALINE SYRINGE (if you find one). FIRST-AIDS, PAINKILLERS / ENERGY DRINKS.</p>
