<p><strong>Helmets</strong> are a type of equipment in PUBG. Helmets provide head protection but they do <strong>NOT</strong> provide extra <strong>capacity.</strong> Head armor will last until fully destroyed by gunfire or other types of   damage and will block the full damage even if it has only 1 point of   armor left. It is useful to pick up a helmet no matter what level it is   as it provides protection against instant-kills with head shots, most of   the time. </p>
<p>For example, a level 3 helmet can still protect you from a headshot even if it's damaged. </p>

<p><strong>Vests</strong> are a type of equipment in PUBG.   They provide basic protection and an increase in carrying capacity.   Each vest increases the carrying capacity by 70 units. Body armor will last until fully destroyed by gunfire or other types of   damage and will block the full damage even if it has only 1 point of   armor left. It is useful to pick up a vest no matter what level it is as   it provides protection against instant-kills with body shots, most of   the time.</p>
<p>For example, a damaged level three vest is better than a full health level 2 vest.</p>

<p>According to this table the akm and groza have more damage due to their ammo type i.e 7.62mm ammo. the aug is the best weapon along with all the attachments. The M416,SCAR-L,M16A4,AUG take 5.56mm ammo. Each weapon's magazine size is 30 bullets. and after attaching extended mag they contain 40 bullets each. Each weapon has two modes-auto and single. but the m16a4 has single and burst fire mode. According to some tests the Akm has the most recoil out of all the ARs ecluding the M16a4 beacuse it burst mode and the AUG has the least recoil.</P>
<p>* AUG and Groza are crate only weapons.</P>

<p>according to test results the awm does the most damage but one downside is that it is a crate only gun.</P>
<p>the awm can take out a level 3 helmet with one shot only. and takes 2 shots to take out level 3 vest.</P>
<p>Sniper Rifles are the ultimate weapons when it comes to range and power.   In general, these rifles suffer from low magazine sizes and a   cripplingly low rate of fire, but are redeemed by their high damage and   extreme range capabilities. Due to the small magazine sizes and slow   rate of fire, one must use these rifles with extreme caution, as one   shot missed could spell the end for the user, and multiple shots missed   means a long time of being vulnerable while reloading or switching   weapons.</P>

<p>the mk14 and the vss have two modes- single and auto. the sks,mini-14,slr are semi automatic rifles. these have reasonable fire rates.the vss has its own type of scope. the rest take all the scope attachments.</P>
<p>DMRs, or Designated Marksman Rifles, are weapons between the <a href="https://pubg.gamepedia.com/Assault_Rifles" title="Assault Rifles">Assault Rifles</a> and <a href="https://pubg.gamepedia.com/Sniper_Rifles" title="Sniper Rifles">Sniper Rifles</a> categories. Broadly speaking, they've got just short of the range of a   sniper rifle, and just slightly higher damage than an assault rifle,   albeit with a slightly lower magazine size. Functionally speaking,   they're a great short to medium range precision rifle, but they're not   that great in assault situations.</P>
