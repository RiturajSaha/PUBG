<p><h1><marquee><u> ABOUT ERANGEL MAP</u></marquee></h1></p>
<P><h2>Erangel, the first PUBG map, is not small - it can't be, if it's going to house hundreds
 upon hundreds of games over and over again - and even though it can feel like second nature at times, the ubiquitous design 
of the buildings, trees, and rolling battleground countryside are easy enough to get lost in.</p>
<br>
<p><u>PUBG Erangel best start locations:</u>

<p><u>Military Base</u> - you will almost always find the game's best loot here, but likewise almost always the most people. If it's under the flight path, expect to fight (and die). If not, it's often worth a quick trek there in a vehicle to loot it in peace, but beware of bridge trolls (people waiting for you on bridges) if the white circle isn't kind! The three big buildings in a U-shape house the best loot, but you'll do well everywhere.</p>
<p><u>Mylta Power</u> - if it's on the edge of the flight path this is an excellent location. Top-level loot, especially in the main green building and surrounding warehouses, and enough for a full squad. Just beware you almost always need a vehicle to get to the first circle.</p>
<p><u>Small Mylta Power</u> - just to the west of Mylta Power is another, smaller plant with one main building. You'll find very high quality loot here, but in much smaller numbers, so it's better for solo and duo than squads.</p>
<p><u>School and Hospital</u> - both of these have huge amounts of loot, but at more of a mid-level in quality. School is currently the most popular place to land, so expect to almost always fight and die if you go there. The Hospital is a great shout it it's right on the edge of your range.</p>
<p><u>Georgopol Crates</u> - the large crates north of the mountains and south of the river, and their surrounding warehouses, have a large amount of very high-quality loot, but are often contested when reachable from the plane. If you can land nearby and drive there it's a better bet, as combat can be tricky. Be sure to climb on top of the crates for the best loot, but beware you're also very exposed!</p>
<p><u>Prison, Mansion, and Bunker</u> - a trio of good quality, good sized places to loot, each has enough for a full squad, but each is also heavily contested when under the flight path. They make good destinations when you can get there safely though, or if you fancy yourself in a scrap.<p>
<p><u>Large towns</u> - the likes of Novoreponye, Lipovka, Rozhok, Pochinki, Yasnaya Polyana, Georgopol, Primorsk, and Severny all make great places to loot, but are all dangerous. Look out for warehouses, cafés and restaurants (the glass-fronted, angular buildings), and churches for high concentrations of the best loot.</p>
<p><u>PUBG Erangel landing strategies</u>
<ul>
<li>Remember the rough distance of 1-2 kilometres/squares as a guide of how far you can get from the flight path, depending on how high you open your parachute.</li>
<li>Know when to jump by lining up the wing of the plane with your marker. When it's perfectly in line (i.e. when the plane is perfectly at a right angle to your location) then jump.</li>
<li>To get max distance fast, press W whilst looking directly up. That means you're diving forwards, quickly, rather than down or slowly.</li>
<li>You get a speed boost to your parachuting if you're at max speed (234mph) when the parachute opens. Do so by looking directly down and holding W.</li>
<li>When your parachute opens, swing to go further. Do so by pressing W until you've swung all the way back, then releasing so your character swings forwards, then press W again when they're at max distance forwards in the swing, and repeat.</li>
<li>One tactic is to pick a map location with a high chance of spawning vehicles, that's away from any conflict. Hop in the vehicle, and then you can drive to a loot-heavy location well across the map (away from any enemies) and give yourself a good 5-7 minutes to loot it, considering it takes 5 minutes for the first blue ring to spawn, and then a couple more for it to actually reach the white-ringed safe zone.</li></ul></p></h2>
