<center><u><p><h1>PUBG Map key things to know:</h1><p></u></center>
<ul><h2>
<li>Each large square represents 1 kilometre, and each smaller square within that is 100 metres, meaning the landmass of the map itself is actually only about 6km across.</li>
<li>The map is very detailed, but one or two structures don't show up - most notable of these is the complex of underground bunkers, found in the sixth square from the left, fourth up from the bottom (or F4, for the cartographers out there).</li>
<li>Different areas have different spawn rates for weapons, vehicles, and loot - a lot of players will aready know this, but it's worth remembering that you're guaranteed a better quality of loot at set locations, and planning accordingly. More on how to make the most of this below!</li>
<li>Within those high loot-spawning areas, there are some specific locations which spawn high amounts of guns and weapons in particular, which are worth prioritising if you're going to land in one of these high-risk zones.</li>
<li>You can glide around 1.25 kilometres (large squares) from the plane's flight path (whidch is randomised in terms of direction but always linear) from the point your parachute automatically triggers, or around two full squares if you trigger it earlier.</li>
<li>Markers can be dropped on the map with Right Mouse-Button, which are perfect for coordinating with a team or just keeping track of your own personal target destination, so use them as often as possible. The compass also uses specific numbers for more precise directional tracking, which should again be used for calling out enemy or point-of-interest locations with a team.</li></h2>
